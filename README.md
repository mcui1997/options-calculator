# Options Strategy Calculators

Simple web-based calculators for two profitable options strategies: the Forward Factor strategy and the Earnings Calendar strategy. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no dependencies required.

## What It Does

**Forward Factor Calculator** - Calculates forward volatility between two option expiries and determines if there's a profitable calendar spread opportunity. Enter the days-to-expiry and implied volatilities for two dates, and it'll tell you if the Forward Factor exceeds the 20% threshold for entry.

**Earnings Calendar Checker** - Validates whether an earnings setup meets all criteria for a profitable calendar spread trade. Checks volume, IV ratios, expected moves, and red flags to give you a clear GO/NO-GO decision.
